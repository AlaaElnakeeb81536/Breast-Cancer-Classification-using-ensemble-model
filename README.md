# Ensemble Machine learning for Breast Cancer Detection

â€” Breast cancer (BC) is a significant concern and   a leading cause of death among women worldwide. Early 
detection and prediction of BC are essential for saving lives. Machine learning (ML) has shown potential in developing 
models to detect and predict various diseases. To make a classification for people who suffer from BC and do not 
suffer from the disease, we present a model that can differentiate between malignant and benign BC cells in this 
paper. 


This code utilizes feature selection (FS) to optimize the features and choose the optimal feature subset. Six 
machine learning models are explored, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-nearest 
neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), and Decision Tree (DT). To evaluate the performance, 
accuracy, F1-score, recall, and precision were computed to evaluate the performance of the classification models 
. The performance of the six machine learning models was tested on the test dataset before and after the 
process of the FS technique.

The experimental results show that the **SVM model and LR have the best results compared 
to other machine learning models with an accuracy of 98.246%, and with FS. To achieve the best performance, voting 
ensemble ML model developed based on RF, SVM and LR. Ensemble models achieve superior performance over other 
traditional ML and over the state of the art** .
